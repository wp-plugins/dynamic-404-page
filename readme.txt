Allows you to select a page to use as the content of your 404 page.

== Description == 

Allows you te set a page to be used as the 404 page. In order for the plugin to work you need to make some modifications to the `404.php` file in your theme. I set it this way so that the 404 page could be formatted to fit the theme, or can be set more dynamically.

Although this plugin will work with Wordpress 2.8, it's better suited for version 3.x.
